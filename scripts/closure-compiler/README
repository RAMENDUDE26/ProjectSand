 For use with the Google closure compiler, so that we can minify
 the javascript code that is calling into the matter.js library.

 DISCLAIMER: This is not a complete set of externs, but rather the
 set of objects and properties currently in use. If you add new
 calls to other matter.js properties, you must also add a declaration
 here, or the closure compiler may silently break the code by rewriting
 things it should not.


 The closure compiler can be invoked like so:

npx google-closure-compiler --externs scripts/closure-compiler/externs.js --js scripts/*.js --compilation_level ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS --js_output_file compiled.js
